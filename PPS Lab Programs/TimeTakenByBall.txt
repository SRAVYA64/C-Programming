/*A building has 10 floors with a floor height of 3 meters each. A ball is dropped from the top of the building. 
Find the time taken by the ball to reach each floor. (Use the formula s = ut+(1/2)at^2 where u and a are the 
initial velocity in m/sec (= 0) and acceleration in m/sec^2 (= 9.8 m/s^2).*/
